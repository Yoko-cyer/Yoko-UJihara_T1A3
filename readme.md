### Scope - what this app will do
This app will allow you to order sushi and show purchased items and bills. It shows a welcoming message and asks you to input your name. Then, it lets you to choose sushi what you like by categories including vegetarian, seafood, meat and hot drinks. After you choose sushis you like, it shows a massage to cconfirm your order. If it is your correct order, it proceeds to a check out and shows the total bills with your purchased items. If not, it asks you to choose sushi again.  

### Purposes and solutions 
This application is built in order to require the complete content of Coder Academy and solve the real-world problems I have been facing at work. This is the one of the required assignments to compelete Term 1. This is also made from my personal reasons. I myself work at a Sushi shop as a sushi chef and sales representative. Through my work, I have encountered problems such as overwoking because of staff shortage and difficulties in communication because of staff's limited English. It also allows to hire impared person and communicate with impared customers. This app also helps to reduce the risk of Covid-19 to minimise contacts with staff and customers. 

### Target audience
I have three types of target audience for this app. First targeted audience is Sushi shop owers wanting to solve overworking due to staff shortage and increase sales. The socond one is employees who are not able to speak or hear or limited to their English. The third one is customers who is not able to speak or hear and bothered to talk in person in a hurry or who is too shay to talk to staff. This app ensures the community that the shop installed comply restrictions of Covid-19 such as social distancing and limitaion of staff in and out of a kitchen.
